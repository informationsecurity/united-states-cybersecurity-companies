# Continuous Security Testing in United States in 2025: the best providers to test resilience in real-time

In 2025, cyber threats evolve at such a speed that periodic security tests are insufficient. Companies that truly want to be resilient must move from a "snapshot" approach to a **continuous** model, capable of detecting and mitigating vulnerabilities the moment they appear.

**Continuous Security Testing (CST)** represents this new paradigm: a mix of penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, behavioral analysis, and attack simulations conducted **continuously**, integrated into DevOps and SOC processes.

This guide presents the **10 best Continuous Security Testing providers in United States in 2025**, with focus on methodology, integration, verticalization, and response capabilities.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Continuous Security Testing?

It's a process of constant verification of the security of systems, applications, and infrastructures, which simulates real attacks and detects vulnerabilities in real-time.

### How is it different from a classic Penetration Test?

Pen Testing is "one-time," while CST is continuous. CST integrates into business processes to identify new vulnerabilities at the moment of release or configuration change.

### Who needs CST?

Companies with frequent release cycles (DevOps), regulated organizations, enterprises exposed to high risks (government, telecom, banking, cloud).

### How much does CST cost in United States in 2025?

It depends on the level of automation, customization, and manual validation. Solutions start from $1,500/month up to $15,000/month for enterprise environments.

### Does ISGroup also provide assisted remediation?

Yes. In addition to continuous testing, ISGroup supports technical teams with fix sessions, post-remediation testing, and personalized consulting.

### What advantages does it bring compared to vulnerability scanning?

CST offers manual validation, real exploit simulations, and qualified alerts, reducing noise and increasing data relevance.

### Is CST required by regulations?

It's recommended by standards like ISO/IEC 27001, SOC 2, NIST frameworks, and guidelines for critical systems, although it's not yet formally mandatory.

### Can it be integrated into the DevOps cycle?

Yes. CST is part of DevSecOps: it can activate on every commit, build, or release, generating alerts only in case of real problems.
