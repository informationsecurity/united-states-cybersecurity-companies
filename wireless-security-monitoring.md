## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Wireless Security Monitoring?
It is a continuous monitoring service for corporate Wi-Fi networks to detect unauthorized devices, wireless attacks (spoofing, rogue APs, deauth), misconfigurations, and policy violations, offering proactive protection.

### When and why is it necessary?
It's needed when the company uses extensive Wi-Fi (BYOD, guest, IoT), especially if handling sensitive data or subject to compliance (PCI DSS, ISO 27001, NIS2). It prevents targeted attacks on wireless networks, often overlooked compared to wired networks.

### What is the average cost?
From about $2,000/month for small sites up to $10,000/month for multi-site implementations with sensors and 24/7 support.

### How do you choose the right provider?
Verify technical competencies (wireless certifications, OT, IoT), methodology (passive monitoring, threat intelligence), activation times (1-3 weeks), SLAs, ability to integrate with SOC/IT.

### What certifications are important?
ISO/IEC 27001, CWNA/CWSP, experience with Wi-Fi 6 standards, experts in OT and IoT certifications are distinguishing elements.
